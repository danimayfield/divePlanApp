# Plan Your Next Scuba Dive!

Developed by Dani Mayfield 2021

## About This App

This application is for scuba divers who are in the process of planning out their next scuba dive! Divers can plan 1-2 consecutive dives and the application will let the diver know when a safety stop is needed as well as if they have hit their no-decompression limit. (If you are not a diver, a no-decompression limit is basically the limit you should not surpass as serious health consequences can occur if they are exceeded.)
Divers may save their dives that they planned in the DiveBook and can go and view other people's dives as well!

## Tech 

This application was built in react javascript, using sass to style and firebase to save and display the user-saved dive information.
